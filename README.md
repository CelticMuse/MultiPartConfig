MultiPartConfig
===============

Microblocks.cfg with values for a lot of mods for 1.7.10 (community built)
If you want to add more values, please make a comment with the name of the mod on top of it for each mod like it already has been made in the file. Makes it far easier to update/customize the config file. And do not be shy, just make pull requests if you have more values that are not yet included :)
